## Developing

This repository contains only the Markdown files for [webpivottable.com](https://webpivottable.com) website.

For developing in local, see instructions on [bright-sea/webpivottable.com](https://github.com/bright-sea/webpivottable.com) repo.

For now, **always check the `en/` version** of a document for its latest revision before starting a translation.
