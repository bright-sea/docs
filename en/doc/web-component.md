### What's Web Component?

Below is a brief excerpt from [webcomponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction):
<p class="Alert Alert--info">
Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, 
reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. 
Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, 
and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.
</p>

Use a web component is just like use a normal HTML tag. 
For example, if we put a HTML tag 'button' on page and it will functional as a button. 
The same as web component, if we put a web component tag on page, we can have a custom component 
with encapsulated logic and style.
