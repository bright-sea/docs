Want to utilize the memory size and performance of a server to do your computations but not have to setup an
expensive OLAP server? Server mode is the third mode offered by WPT which loads data and calculations from a
dedicated server into the WPT client. Server mode acts exactly like memory mode but hands off computational
tasks to a server setup to work with the WPT as a client.
