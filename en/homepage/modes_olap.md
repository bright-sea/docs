OLAP (online analytical processing) infrastructures enable users to analyze multidimensional data interactively.
In OLAP mode, WPT can connect to an OLAP server that handles data and computation. WPT then acts as an interface
for pivotting and displaying the data.

There are a lot of OLAP server implementations. Microsoft SSAS is a widely used commercial solution while
open source solutions such as Mondrian, icCube and OLAPY are also supported by WPT.
